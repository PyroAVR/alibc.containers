FIX ARRAY ITERATOR TEST - MEMORY LEAK AFTER NULL ITERATOR CHECKS

 - might go for the "choose implementation at link time" strat for now, esp. re: dynamic vs. static memory.
 - Whatever choice is made in the dynabuf will fix the memory allocation for all other data structures
   - will not fix the general problem though. If you want a linked list and a contiguous list that both use array_set, gg.
   - could fix this at a higher level though, via protocol objects...


 - Remember the ALC guidelines:
   - let the developer choose
   - expose lower-level features in each standalone implementation
   - abstract away convenience features to higher layers (protocols :))
   - minimize complexity wherever possible.
   - minimize dependencies wherever possible (read: coupling)


todo:
 - static dynabuf
 - allocator abstraction
